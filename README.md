Lightweight Remote Job Management
===

Manage computational jobs on a cluster from your desktop computer.

This toolkit contains command-line tools to submit batches of jobs, cancel batches of jobs, upload files, download files, clean up job directories.
All commands are issued over a single SSH connection to achieve robustness and scalability.

Born out of frustration with notoriously unreliable and non-scaling Grid Middleware stacks.

This is not yet a general-purpose tool, but tailored for researchers using the Auckland NeSI cluster.
The batch scheduling system in use is Slurm.
